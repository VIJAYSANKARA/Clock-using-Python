# Clock-using-Python
This Python program creates a digital clock using Tkinter. It displays the current time in 12-hour format (HH:MM:SS AM/PM) and updates every 200 milliseconds. The GUI includes a title and a large, styled time display, making it a simple and effective real-time clock application.
